# Book-CRUD Changed Afterwards 2

You need to run both front-end & back-end projects. 

For running backend:
1. clone the repository
2. open new terminal
3. go to /books-backend
4. run "npm i"
5. run "npm start"

The backend project should be started now on port 4000


For running front-end:
1. clone the repository
2. open new terminal
3. go to /books-frontend
4. run "npm i"
5. run "npm start"

The frontend project should be started now on port 3000

open the browser and go to "http://localhost:3000/" to see the starting page


Thank you for your attention
